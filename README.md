# Grid-Security-Dashboard
Objective:

This project aims to simulate a secure grid environment and visualize key processes such as task allocation, traffic monitoring, and real-time threat detection using a web-based interface. It incorporates animations, live metrics, and custom analytics to make the simulation interactive and insightful.

Core Features:

1. Grid Simulation:

Visual representation of a grid with nodes that dynamically update as tasks are allocated.

Nodes change color to indicate task allocation, enhancing user engagement.

2. Real-Time Monitoring:

Simulated traffic flow with metrics like packets per second and dropped packets.

3. Performance Analysis:

Metrics for throughput (tasks/sec) and latency (ms) are calculated in real-time.

Metrics help analyze grid performance and identify potential bottlenecks.

Technical Details:

1. Frontend Technologies:

HTML: Structure for the grid simulation and metrics display.

CSS: Styling for a visually appealing and interactive design.

JavaScript: Core logic for real-time updates, simulations, and animations.



2. Grid Simulation:

Nodes are represented as interactive elements.

Tasks are randomly assigned to nodes, with animations indicating activity.

3. Traffic Monitoring:

Randomized data generation simulates real-time traffic flow and packet dropping.

4. Performance Analysis:

Real-time metrics like throughput and latency are dynamically calculated and updated on the UI.

Usage Scenario:

This project can be used as:

An educational tool to demonstrate grid security principles and task allocation mechanisms.

A proof of concept for simulating secure environments in grid computing.

A research prototype for testing algorithms in resource scheduling and threat detection.
